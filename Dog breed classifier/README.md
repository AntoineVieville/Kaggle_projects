I found a 70 dog breeds images dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set/data).
Since I have a dog, I figured it could be fun to work on a dog breed classifier that would be able to recognize what breed he is :)

Notebook contains : 
- display of some data
- data preprocessing
- CNN model building using Keras
- model training and evaluation
- transfer learning (Mobile Net V2)
- prediction of my dog's breeds on several pictures
